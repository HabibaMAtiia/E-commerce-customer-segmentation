# E-commerce-customer-segmentation
## Project Overview
- This project aims to segment customers based on their transactional behavior using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups that can be targeted with personalized coupons to enhance loyalty and satisfaction. In addition to the customer segmentation, a dashboard was designed to present key insights from the dataset for business managers and marketing teams. This dashboard helps stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions by visualizing customer behaviors and trends.
## Dataset
- The dataset includes several tables, such as:
  - Customers Table: Contains customer demographic information (gender, city).
  - Transactions Table: Records coupon usage history (claimed, burnt).
  - Branches, Merchants, Cities Tables: Additional information about coupon burn locations.
